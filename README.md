# Log-Analysis-and-Anomaly-Detection
This project implements a robust log analysis and anomaly detection system designed to detect potential security threats in real-time. The system can process log data from various sources, including CSV files and real-time network connections, and it uses machine learning techniques to identify unusual patterns that may indicate security breaches.
